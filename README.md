# CS-305

# Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?
Artemis Fincial is an exclusively online banking company that operates globally. The company wanted software that was able to securely store customer dataand ensure all communications reemained secured.

# What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
I think I did well when it came to identifying solutions. I found that updating the plugins solved most of the issues almost immediately. It is important to code securely because there is a lot of potential for damage if data inside software is not properly protected, especially when it involves customer data. If a company has a reputation of having high quality security, then customers are more likely to trust them with their sensitve information. On the opposite end, if data is notriously leaked, attacked successfully, then there is a lot less trust between the business and customer.

# Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
It was definitely daunting when I was reviewing the vulnerabilities and their descriptions. I found myself overwhelmed sometimes but as I was reading their fixes I realized most of them can be fixed by updating the dependencies. I also had trouble filtering out false postiives.

# How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
I increased security by making sure all used dependencies are up to date and potnetial vulnerabilites are handled accordingly. I checked to see if there were better ways to keep my code secure and took whatever actions necessary to do so.

# How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
I would test my code to make sure it worked as intended. I also ran a dependency check before and after I coded, and compared the number of vulnerabilities. If any new ones were introduced, I eliminated them accordingly.

# What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
OWASP was a great tool in helping me learn about vulnerabilites found in my code and how to eliminate them, I will definitely be using it in the future.

# Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment
I would showcase my ability to navigate dependency reports and my ability to analyze their suggested fixes.
